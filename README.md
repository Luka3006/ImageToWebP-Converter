# ImageToWebp-Converter
A python tool to convert unlimited images (.png, .jpg) to .webp images.

### How to use it
1. Download the files
2. Put your images into the "input" folder
3. Run the Python Script (Python 3.9)
4. Your converted images are located in the "output" folder

### How it works
The python script uses the [WebP Conversion Tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)_ and just runs this tool over every file in the "input" folder.
